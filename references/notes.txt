#Note I use both OpenCV and SKImage, should migrate the repo to use only one. Probably SKImage. Easier to use

# TODO pipeline to properly generate trainig data for segmentation net using SpaceNet dataset

# Note Try to think about an image quality metric to choose if we use it to train
# Note Validate no duplicate in image in val set
